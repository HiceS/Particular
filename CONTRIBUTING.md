# Contributing to SharpMesh

### Code of Conduct

You are expected to uphold the minimum coding standards described in this file, TODO: add more info

### Steps for Contributions

1. Clone the repo `git clone -r https://github.com/HiceS/SharpMesh` or fork the repo using the built in github functionality
2. Make a new branch to designate the start of your work `git checkout -b name_feature`
3. Implement your feature.
4. Put in a pull request with us.

> Note:
> In order to use the Unity plugin, you have to clone the git submodule as well - see the README.

### How can I contribute?

* We could always use more decomposition algorithms, or improvements to the efficiency or accuracy of our existing ones.
* More testing functionality is needed to ensure we can maintain stability as features grow.
* Do you love .gltf? .fbx format? .wad? Currently there's only native functionality for decoding .obj files, add your favorite.
* The [Unity Plugin](https://github.com/Tattomoosa/SharpMeshUnityPlugin) could use some love too!
* Did we mention tests? 

### Making Issues

Please describe your issue in as much detail as possible.

### Coding Standards

We only accept the finest, freshest code. We recommend only working on SharpMesh while bathing in untouched mountain springs under new fallen snow.
For every coding session, a new mountain spring *must* be found. They are then spoiled, ruined by human touch, never to be pure again.

Code must be written through in the order it will execute and compile/run properly with correct behavior on your first try.
If it doesn't, you must throw your computer into the fires of an active volcano and start again fresh.
Such is the overwhelming quality required by the SharpMesh codebase.

> Note:
> This is obviously just some silly nonsense. We are still evaluating acceptable Coding Standards for the SharpMesh project.
> For now, if the code runs and does a thing that's useful we're happy to take it.
